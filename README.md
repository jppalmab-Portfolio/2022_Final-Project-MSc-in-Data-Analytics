This project is the Final Research for the MSc Data Analytics degree. It focused on identifying the structure of the Constitutional Convention in Chile during 2021-2022 using network analysis. 

**Abstract**-Chile has been on a journey of 20 years since it started to feel the first cracks in the political system inherited by the military dictatorship. After the massive protest in October 2019, the need for a new Constitution was obvious. During 2021-2022 a group of 154 members discussed and wrote the new Constitution in Chile. The Convention is an unusual effort into the political tradition in Chile and the essential process in the last 50 years. This paper contributes to understanding the Convention work based on the co-voting range to describe the alliances and agreements reached, and at the same time, be a valuable contribution to Computer Social Science as an academic field and the social network analysis an invaluable method for this purpose.

As an extension of this work, you will find the presentation at the First Chilean Social Network Congress, where I presented this article. Currently, I am working on an extension of this project in a paper, and the goal is to be published in 2023.
