Welcome to the repository of my Final Research project for the MSc Data Analytics degree. This project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of the structure and relative position of members of the Constitutional Convention in Chile during the period of 2021-2022, utilizing network analysis techniques.

**Abstract:**

Chile has undergone a transformative journey over the past 20 years, marked by the recognition of cracks in the political system inherited from the military dictatorship. Following the massive protests in October 2019, the urgent need for a new Constitution became evident. In response, a group of 154 members convened and deliberated, ultimately drafting the new Constitution for Chile. This Constitutional Convention represents a unique and significant political endeavor, unprecedented in the country's recent history.

The objective of this research project is to contribute to a deeper understanding of the Convention's work by employing network analysis methodologies. By analyzing the co-voting patterns, we aim to uncover the alliances, agreements, and relationships formed within the Convention. This study not only sheds light on the internal dynamics of the Convention but also serves as a valuable contribution to the emerging field of Computer Social Science and social network analysis as an invaluable methodology for studying complex political processes.
